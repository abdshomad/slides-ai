# 4.3. Step 2: Outline Generation

*   **F-OG-01:** The AI shall generate a presentation outline based on the text and file inputs.
*   **F-OG-02 (Web Research):** The AI uses Google Search to gather up-to-date information, enhancing the outline's quality and relevance.
*   **F-OG-03 (Source Citing):** The URLs of web sources used by the AI are displayed below the outline for user reference and verification.
*   **F-OG-04 (Title Generation):** The AI suggests a concise and engaging title for the presentation based on the content.
*   **F-OG-05 (Outline Editing & Review):** The generated outline is displayed as an interactive, visual preview of the slide structure.
    *   Users can optionally display a text editor to directly modify the raw outline content.
    *   The visual preview updates in real-time as the user types in the editor.
    *   The preview pane offers two distinct views: a detailed "List" view and a "Diagram" view that renders the presentation flow as a flowchart.
*   **F-OG-06 (Interactive Layout Previews):**
    *   **F-OG-06a:** Alongside each slide in the outline preview, a visual wireframe of the AI's suggested slide layout is displayed.
    *   **F-OG-06b:** The layout wireframe is interactive. Clicking it opens a modal allowing the user to select a different layout for that specific slide before the main content generation.
*   **F-OG-07 (Tone & Template Selection):**
    *   Users can select a content tone (e.g., Professional, Casual, Enthusiastic) from a dropdown list.
    *   Users must choose a visual design template from a gallery of predefined options.
*   **F-OG-08 (Real-time Slide Count):** The UI shall display a real-time count of the total number of slides based on the current state of the outline, providing immediate feedback as the user makes edits.
*   **F-OG-09 (Direct Outline Manipulation):** Users can directly add or remove slides from the outline preview.
    *   **F-OG-09a:** Each slide in the preview has a remove button, allowing for quick deletion.
    *   **F-OG-09b:** Users can insert a new, blank slide at any point in the outline via interactive controls in the preview.
*   **F-OG-10 (Intelligent Layout Suggestion):** During outline generation, the AI analyzes each slide's content and automatically selects the most effective layout to represent the information (e.g., choosing a "Timeline" layout for chronological steps or a "Comparison" layout for contrasting ideas).
