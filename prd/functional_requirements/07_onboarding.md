# 4.7. Onboarding & User Guidance

*   **F-ON-01 (Automated Tour for New Users):** A guided, interactive tour automatically starts for first-time users to introduce them to the application's core workflow.
*   **F-ON-02 (Manual Tour Activation):** Users can manually restart the tour at any time via a "Tour" button in the application header.
*   **F-ON-03 (Interactive Highlighting):** The tour highlights specific UI elements and displays a popover with explanatory text for each step, guiding the user's focus.
*   **F-ON-04 (Multi-View Navigation):** The tour can navigate the user between different application views (e.g., from the main input screen to the sample presentation view) to showcase features across the entire app.
*   **F-ON-05 (User Control):** Users have full control to navigate forwards and backwards through the tour steps or to skip the tour entirely at any point.
*   **F-ON-06 (Tour Completion State):** The application remembers if a user has completed or skipped the tour to prevent it from auto-starting on subsequent visits, ensuring a smooth experience for returning users.
