## Active Development

This phase introduces features to enhance content intelligence and presentation delivery.

*   **Presenter Coach:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes speaker notes and slide content to provide real-time feedback on pacing, clarity, and engagement during practice runs.

---

## Future Exploration

This phase targets deeper integration with existing ecosystems and introduces advanced features for professional and power users.

*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to view and edit the presentation outline and slides simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time for all participants.
*   **Direct Cloud Integration:** Add options to save and export presentations directly to Google Drive (as Google Slides) or Microsoft OneDrive (as PowerPoint).
*   **Advanced Data Visualization:** Building upon the existing chart generation, this feature would enable the AI to generate complex charts, graphs, and tables from structured data (e.g., CSV upload, pasted table).
*   **Advanced Animation Control:** Allow the AI to suggest and apply subtle, professional animations to bullet points and slide transitions to improve the presentation's narrative flow.
