# 7. Future Enhancements & Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the AI Presentation Designer, detailing potential features and improvements for future versions. Our goal is to expand its capabilities and solidify its position as a best-in-class tool for intelligent presentation creation.

## Product Roadmap Overview

The roadmap is organized into three distinct phases, prioritizing features that deliver the most significant impact on visual creativity, content intelligence, and user collaboration.

## Phase 1: Advanced Visual Creativity (Completed)

This phase delivered a suite of features giving users unparalleled creative control over their presentation visuals.

*   **AI In-Painting ("Magic Edit"):** Users can now edit generated images directly on the slide using natural language prompts within the Image Studio. This feature, powered by the `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model, supports adding or removing objects and modifying image styles.
*   **Advanced Generation Controls:** The Image Studio's "Generate" tab provides granular control over image generation. Users can provide negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements and select from a wide range of artistic styles (e.g., "Watercolor," "3D Render," "Vector Art") to guide the AI.
*   **Presentation-Wide Style Cohesion:** An "Apply Style to All" function was implemented, allowing users to select an artistic style and apply it consistently across all image-generating slides in their presentation, ensuring a cohesive and professional aesthetic.

## Phase 2: Smarter Content & Collaboration (In Progress)

Building on the strong visual foundation, this phase introduces features to enhance content intelligence, presentation delivery, and introduce multi-user workflows.

*   **[Active] AI-Suggested Layouts:** The AI will analyze the content of a slide (e.g., a list of steps, a comparison of two products) and proactively suggest the most effective layout (e.g., Timeline, Comparison) to best represent the information.
*   **[Done] Expanded Image Sourcing:** Integrated a stock photo search feature directly into the Image Studio, providing a wider, more curated selection of high-quality visual assets from third-party royalty-free image providers.
*   **Presenter Coach:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes speaker notes and slide content to provide real-time feedback on pacing, clarity, and engagement during practice runs.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to view and edit the presentation outline and slides simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time for all participants.

## Phase 3: Ecosystem & Power-User Features (Future Exploration)

This phase targets deeper integration with existing ecosystems and introduces advanced features for professional and power users.

*   **Direct Cloud Integration:** Add options to save and export presentations directly to Google Drive (as Google Slides) or Microsoft OneDrive (as PowerPoint).
*   **Advanced Data Visualization:** Building upon the existing chart generation, this feature would enable the AI to generate complex charts, graphs, and tables from structured data (e.g., CSV upload, pasted table).
*   **Advanced Animation Control:** Allow the AI to suggest and apply subtle, professional animations to bullet points and slide transitions to improve the presentation's narrative flow.
