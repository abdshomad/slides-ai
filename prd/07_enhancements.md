# 7. Future Enhancements & Roadmap

This document outlines potential features and improvements for future versions of the AI Presentation Designer, aimed at expanding its capabilities and enhancing the user experience.

### UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Presenter Coach:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes speaker notes and slide content to provide real-time feedback on pacing, clarity, and engagement during practice runs.
*   **Advanced Animation Control:** Allow the AI to suggest and apply subtle, professional animations to bullet points and slide transitions to improve the presentation's narrative flow.

### Content & AI Capabilities

*   **AI-Suggested Layouts:** The AI will analyze the content of a slide (e.g., a list of steps, a comparison of two products) and proactively suggest the most effective layout (e.g., Timeline, Comparison) to best represent the information.
*   **Advanced Data Visualization:** Building upon the existing chart generation from text prompts, this feature would enable the AI to generate complex charts, graphs, and tables from structured data (e.g., CSV upload, pasted table).

### Integration & Collaboration

*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to edit the presentation outline and view slide changes simultaneously, similar to Google Slides or Figma.
*   **Direct Cloud Integration:** Add options to save and export presentations directly to Google Drive (as Google Slides) or Microsoft OneDrive (as PowerPoint).
*   **Expanded Image Sourcing:** Integrate directly with royalty-free image APIs like Unsplash and Pexels to provide a wider, more curated selection of high-quality visual assets.

### Next Enhancement Candidates

*   **Hide "Editable Outline" section:** The editable outline text area could be hidden by default to simplify the UI, and only shown when requested by the user.
*   **Visual Content Tone Selection:** Enhance the "Choose a Content Tone" selector with icons or thumbnail previews to better communicate the style of each tone.
*   **Post-Generation Image Preview:** After the "Crafting your presentation..." process, show a sample gallery of relevant images sourced during the research step.
*   **Hide Export Slide Button:** The individual slide export button could be moved or hidden to streamline the UI.
*   **Grouped Slide Actions:** All actions on an individual slide should be grouped into a single dropdown action button to reduce clutter.
