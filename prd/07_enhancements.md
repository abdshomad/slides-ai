# 7. Future Enhancements & Roadmap

This document outlines potential features and improvements for future versions of the AI Presentation Designer, aimed at expanding its capabilities and enhancing the user experience.

### UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Presenter Coach:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes speaker notes and slide content to provide real-time feedback on pacing, clarity, and engagement during practice runs.
*   **Advanced Animation Control:** Allow the AI to suggest and apply subtle, professional animations to bullet points and slide transitions to improve the presentation's narrative flow.

### Content & AI Capabilities

*   **AI-Suggested Layouts:** The AI will analyze the content of a slide (e.g., a list of steps, a comparison of two products) and proactively suggest the most effective layout (e.g., Timeline, Comparison) to best represent the information.
*   **Advanced Data Visualization:** Building upon the existing chart generation from text prompts, this feature would enable the AI to generate complex charts, graphs, and tables from structured data (e.g., CSV upload, pasted table).

### Image Generation & Editing

*   **AI In-Painting and Out-Painting ("Magic Edit"):** Leveraging models like Nano Banana, this feature would allow users to edit images directly on the slide using natural language.
    *   **Add/Remove Objects:** "Add a laptop on the table" or "Remove the car from the background."
    *   **Style Modification:** "Make the sky look more dramatic" or "Change this photo to black and white."
    *   **Generative Fill:** Allow users to expand the canvas of an image, with the AI intelligently filling in the new space to fit the slide layout perfectly.
*   **Advanced Generation Controls:** Provide users with more granular control over the image generation process, inspired by professional prompting techniques.
    *   **Negative Prompts:** An input field to specify what to exclude from an image (e.g., "text, watermarks, blurry").
    *   **Style & Camera Presets:** Easy-to-use dropdowns or buttons for applying specific styles ("Watercolor," "3D Render," "Vector Art") or camera effects ("Cinematic Lighting," "Macro Shot," "35mm lens").
*   **Presentation-Wide Style Cohesion:** An AI tool that can analyze all images in a presentation and apply a consistent visual style (e.g., "apply a minimalist line art style to all illustrations") to create a more cohesive and professional look.

### Integration & Collaboration

*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to edit the presentation outline and view slide changes simultaneously, similar to Google Slides or Figma.
*   **Direct Cloud Integration:** Add options to save and export presentations directly to Google Drive (as Google Slides) or Microsoft OneDrive (as PowerPoint).
*   **Expanded Image Sourcing:** Integrate directly with royalty-free image APIs like Unsplash and Pexels to provide a wider, more curated selection of high-quality visual assets.

### Next Enhancement Candidates
e
Based on the ideas outlined above, the following are strong candidates for the next development cycle:
*   **AI In-Painting and Out-Painting ("Magic Edit")**
*   **Advanced Generation Controls**
*   **AI-Suggested Layouts**
*   **Real-time Collaboration**
