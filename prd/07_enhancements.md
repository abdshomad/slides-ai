## Phase 1: Advanced Visual Creativity (Completed)

This phase delivered a suite of features giving users unparalleled creative control over their presentation visuals.

*   **AI In-Painting ("Magic Edit"):** Users can now edit generated images directly on the slide using natural language prompts within the Image Studio. This feature, powered by the `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model, supports adding or removing objects and modifying image styles.
*   **Advanced Generation Controls:** The Image Studio's "Generate" tab provides granular control over image generation. Users can provide negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements and select from a wide range of artistic styles (e.g., "Watercolor," "3D Render," "Vector Art") to guide the AI.
*   **Presentation-Wide Style Cohesion:** An "Apply Style to All" function was implemented, allowing users to select an artistic style and apply it consistently across all image-generating slides in their presentation, ensuring a cohesive and professional aesthetic.

## Phase 2: Smarter Content & Collaboration (In Progress)

Building on the strong visual foundation, this phase introduces features to enhance content intelligence, presentation delivery, and introduce multi-user workflows.

*   **[Done] AI-Suggested Layouts:** The AI now analyzes the content for each slide during the outline phase and automatically selects the most effective layout to represent the information (e.g., choosing a "Timeline" layout for chronological steps or a "Comparison" layout for contrasting ideas).
*   **[Done] Expanded Image Sourcing:** Integrated a stock photo search feature directly into the Image Studio, providing a wider, more curated selection of high-quality visual assets from third-party royalty-free image providers.
*   **[Done] AI-Powered Chart Generation:** Users can now generate bar, line, and pie charts directly within a slide by providing data or instructions in natural language.
*   **[Active] Presenter Coach:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes speaker notes and slide content to provide real-time feedback on pacing, clarity, and engagement during practice runs.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to view and edit the presentation outline and slides simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time for all participants.

## Phase 3: Ecosystem & Power-User Features (Future Exploration)

This phase targets deeper integration with existing ecosystems and introduces advanced features for professional and power users.

*   **Direct Cloud Integration:** Add options to save and export presentations directly to Google Drive (as Google Slides) or Microsoft OneDrive (as PowerPoint).
*   **Advanced Data Visualization:** Building upon the existing chart generation, this feature would enable the AI to generate complex charts, graphs, and tables from structured data (e.g., CSV upload, pasted table).
*   **Advanced Animation Control:** Allow the AI to suggest and apply subtle, professional animations to bullet points and slide transitions to improve the presentation's narrative flow.
